This sample demonstrates use of a GeometryService to measure area and perimeter.  To use the sample, click subsequent points on the map to draw a polygon.  Double-click to complete the polygon.  Once the polygon is completed, its area and perimeter will be calculated and displayed in the upper right corner of the application.

In the code-behind, a GeometryService is used to first project the polygon into a spatial reference that uses measured units, and then to calculate the area and perimeter of the polygon.
