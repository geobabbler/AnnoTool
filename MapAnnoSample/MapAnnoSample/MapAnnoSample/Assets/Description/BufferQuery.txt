This sample demonstrates using a geometry service to generate query geometry.  To use the sample, simply click on the map.  The click point will be buffered and parcels that intersect the buffer will be retrieved and drawn.

In the code-behind, a GeometryService is used to generate the buffer from the click point.  A QueryTask is then used to perform a query using the buffer geometry.
