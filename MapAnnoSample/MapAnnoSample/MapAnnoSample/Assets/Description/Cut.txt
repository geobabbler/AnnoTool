This sample demonstrates using an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Tasks GeometryService that takes an input polyline graphic that cuts across one on more boundaries of another polygon graphics layer to generate a new set of polygon graphics that are defined by the cutting polyline.

To use the sample, add a polyline to cut and thus subdivide intersecting parcel polygons.
