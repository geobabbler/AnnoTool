This sample includes a Map and a couple ArcGIS Server dynamic map service layers.  The extent property of the map is set to an envelope.  The envelope's projection id (WKID) defines the spatial reference for the map and reprojects dynamic layers (map service and graphics) for display in the map.  Tiled map service layers will not (should not) be reprojected on the fly.  For optimal performance, confirm that the tiled map service layers have the same spatial reference as that defined for the map.
