This sample demonstrates using an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Tasks GeometryService that takes an input graphic polyline and point and returns the linear difference of the shortest length between the two graphics. 

To use the sample, click on the map to add a polyline then add a point.  After the point is entered the shortest distance between them is displayed in the textblock on the map.
