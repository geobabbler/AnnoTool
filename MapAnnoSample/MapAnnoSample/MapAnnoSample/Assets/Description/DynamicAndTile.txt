This sample includes a Map, an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer as a base layer and an ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer on top.  The ArcGIS Server dynamic map service is assigned partial opacity to visualize the layer underneath.  The startup extent of the map is also assigned as the minimum and maximum coordinates for an envelope in map units.  The coordinate system and map units for a map are defined by the first layer in the Map's layers collection.
