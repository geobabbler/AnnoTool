This sample demonstrates using the ESRI.ArcGIS.Client Editor on a FeatureLayer where the edit changes are saved automatically. Individual Editor functions like: Add, Select, ClearSelection, EditVerticies, etc. are bound to Buttons using the Command property. Additional Editor functions like: Freehand, AutoComplete, AutoSelect, and ContinuousMode are bound to CheckBoxes using the IsChecked property.

To use the sample, use the Add Feature button to select a template and draw a feature on the map.  Use other buttons to move or select and delete features.  All changes are automatically committed to the database.
