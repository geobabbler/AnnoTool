This sample demonstrates applying filters to a Feature Layer.  Filters allow you to retrieve a subset of records from a map service layer or spatial data service table that match an attribute or spatial query.  The sample includes to feaure layers, one with an attribute filter and the other with a spatial filter.  As the sample shows, an attribute filter is specified by defining a query in the layer's Where property.  A spatial filter is specified by defining the layer's Geometry property.
