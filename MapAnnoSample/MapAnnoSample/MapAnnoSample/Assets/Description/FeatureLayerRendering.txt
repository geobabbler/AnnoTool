This sample demonstrates different rendering options for feature layers.  The cities layer uses cluster symbology with custom background and foreground colors specified.  The states layer uses a class breaks renderer that renders symbology based on a population density field.  The rivers layer uses the FeatureSymbol property to specify a custom symbol that animates when moused over.
