This sample demonstrates the Feature Layer.  Feature layers allow you to easily plot layers from a map service or tables from a spatial data service as graphics on a map.  As the sample XAML shows, this simply requires declaring a FeatureLayer element in the Map's layers collection and specifying the URL to the layer or table.  You can also filter features by attribute by declaring a Where clause and specify the color of the simple by specifying the Color property.
