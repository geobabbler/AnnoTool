This sample demonstrates displaying an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.ToolkitDataSources GeoRSS feed draped over an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer. The GeoRSS feed is provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and shows the point locations of major earthquakes (Magnitude 5+) over the last 7 days. A StaticResouce is defined to specify the symbology of the points using a ESRI.ArcGIS.Client SimpleRenderer.
