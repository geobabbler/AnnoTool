This sample demonstrates the redline, spatial query, and clear graphics actions.  To use the redline action, click Redline from the menu in the upper right corner, then click and drag in the map to draw a line freehand.  To use the spatial query, click Spatial Query in the menu and click and drag a query box in the map.  To clear the Redline or Spatial Query graphics, use the menu's Clear buttons.

In the sample XAML, the actions are attached to Buttons inside the Grid that comprises the menu.  The key elements in the XAML are these Button elements.  Examining these, you can see that these actions can be easily attached to a button's click event in XAML.  The Redline action requires a color for the line, a draw mode (e.g. FreeHand), and the name of the target Map control.  The Spatial Query action requires the ID of a GraphicsLayer for drawing the results, a symbol to apply to the result graphics, the URL to a layer or table to query, a draw mode to define how the query geometry is drawn, and the name of the target Map control.  The Clear Graphics action only requires the ID of the GraphicsLayer to clear graphics from and the name of the Map control containing the GraphicsLayer.
