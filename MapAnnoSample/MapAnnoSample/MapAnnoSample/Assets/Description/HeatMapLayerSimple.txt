This sample demonstrates creating an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Toolkit.DataSources HeatMapLayer draped over an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer. A 'heat map' is a color image (ranging from blue to red to yellow) that demonstrates the spatial intensity of a set of points (HeatMapPoints). Use the slider to change the intensity of the heat map.  The intensity defines the size of cells in a matrix used to calculate density. An intensity of 1 shows all of the HeatMapPoints individually. The HeatMapPoints are randomly generated across map surface.
