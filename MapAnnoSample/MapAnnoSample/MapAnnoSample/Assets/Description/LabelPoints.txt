This sample demonstrates use of a GeometryService to calculate the location of label points.  To use the sample, click the Add New Polygon button, then click subsequent points on the map to draw a polygon.  Double-click to complete the polygon.  When a polygon is completed, a label point for the polygon will be calculated and shown on the map.

In the code-behind, a GeometryService is used to first simplify the polygon and then get a label point.  When the label point is returned, it is added to the map.
