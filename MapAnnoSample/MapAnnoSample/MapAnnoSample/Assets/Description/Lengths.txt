This sample demonstrates use of a GeometryService to measure distances.  To use the sample, click subsequent points on the map to draw a line.  Double-click to complete the line.  When the line is completed, it's distance will be calculated and displayed in the upper right corner of the application.

In the code-behind, a GeometryService is used to first project the line into a spatial reference that uses measured units, and then to calculate the length of the line.
