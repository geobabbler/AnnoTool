This sample demonstrates how to change the duration (in seconds) of animation displayed by the map during a zoom or pan action.  If 0, no animation is used and the map responds immediately to the action. In greater than 0, the value indicates the duration of an animation after a pan or zoom action.  The animation experience is designed to enhance the user interaction with the map to provide a more aesthetic and fluid experience. In practice, durations should not exceed 2 seconds.
