This sample demonstrates adding FeatureLayers that use MapIt Spatial Data Service tables as their data sources.  In the sample's XAML, FeatureLayers are declared that have their Url property specified as endpoints for MapIt Spatial Data Service tables.  On the point FeatureLayer, clustering, OutFields, and MapTips are declared - just as they can be when using ArcGIS Server data.
