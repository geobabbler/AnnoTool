This sample demonstrates the Toolkit's MapTips control.  Hover over a state and you will see a MapTip appear.  Click the MapTip to view the state's attributes.  The MapTip control is declared inside a Canvas element in the sample's XAML.  The state graphics are generated using a QueryTask in the sample's code-behind.  After the GraphicsLayer has been populated with the state graphics, the MapTips control is initialized by passing the GraphicsLayer to the MapTips.GraphicsLayer property.
