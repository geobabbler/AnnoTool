This sample demonstrates the Toolkit's OverviewMap control.  This control provides a map that indicates the extent of the parent map with a red rectangle.  The parent map can be navigated by clicking and dragging the rectangle.  The sample XAML shows that use of the OverviewMap requires declaring an OverviewMap element, binding to a Map control, and declaring a layer.  The layer shown can be different from that shown in the parent map.
