This sample demonstrates using an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Tasks GeometryService that takes an input graphic point that was created using decimal degrees and projects the return graphic point to Web Mercator. 

To use the sample, enter an X and Y coordinate value in decimal degrees (WGS84) and click Project to transform the coordinate to Web Mercator and add it to the map.
