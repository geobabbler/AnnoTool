This sample demonstrates connecting to an ESRI Spatial Data Service (SDS) to access spatially enabled data stored natively in SQL Server. Spatially enabled data is retrieved as a native FeatureLayer from the SDS and displayed in the map. Additionally, the Clusterer and MapTips properties of the returned results of the FeatureLayer are used to display attribute data when the mouse is hovered over returned point features.
