This sample demonstrates connecting to an ESRI Spatial Data Service (SDS) to access spatially enabled data stored natively in SQL Server. Point data is obtained by a QueryTask and added to the GraphicsLayer as graphics elements on the fly. Additionally, the FlareClusterer class is used on the returned results of the QueryTask to display attribute data when the mouse is hovered over the graphic.
