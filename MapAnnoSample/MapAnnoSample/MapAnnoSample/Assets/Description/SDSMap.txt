This sample demonstrates connecting to an ESRI Spatial Data Service (SDS) to access spatially enabled data stored natively in SQL Server. Spatially enabled point and polygon data obtained by a QueryTask and a native FeatureLayer’s from the SDS are added to the map on the fly. The ClassBreaksRenderer, UniqueValueRenderer, and FlareClusterer classes are used to symbolize the returned data in various formats.
