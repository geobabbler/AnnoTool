This sample demonstrates connecting to an ESRI Spatial Data Service (SDS) to access spatially enabled data stored natively in SQL Server. Spatially enabled data is retrieved as a native FeatureLayer from the SDS and displayed in the map. Various properties of the FeatureLayer (like: Mode, Where, Renderer, and OutFields) are used to restrict what data is returned and how it is rendered (UniqueValueRenderer and ClassBreaksRenderer) from the SDS.
