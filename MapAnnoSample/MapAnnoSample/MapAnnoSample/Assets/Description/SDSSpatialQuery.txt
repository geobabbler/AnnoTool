This sample demonstrates connecting to an ESRI Spatial Data Service (SDS) to access spatially enabled data stored natively in SQL Server. An ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Toolkit Toolbar is used to provide ToolbarItem's for drawing graphics (Point, Polyline, Polygon, and Rectangle) on the map which are then used as inputs for a QueryTask to retrieve polygon graphics from the SDS service. The return results from the QueryTask are added to the GraphicsLayer as graphics elements on the fly. Additionally, attribute information from the QueryTask is displayed in 'Search Results' DataGrid. Once the selection set is returned from the QueryTask and displayed, the mouse can then either be hovered over the graphics on the map or the attributes in the DataGrid and they will be highlighted simultaneously as they are bound together.
