This sample displays the the tracks of hurricanes of the coast of the United States during 3 day intervals in the summer and fall of 2000.   Use the TimeSlider control to view sections of time within this period.   The hurricanes data is hosted in a point feature layer in an ArcGIS Server map service and added to the map as a FeatureLayer.  Each point is an event in time.  Multiple features may be associated with the same event, just at different points in time.  A client-side temporal renderer is applied to the hurricane feature layer.  The renderer uses the TrackIdField to associate events in the data which it uses to generate tracks (lines).   The latest observation is a custom marker symbol that contains a rotating hurricane icon and a label with the name and windspeed.  The observation symbol is aged to decrease in opacity as the time extent of the map progresses.  

To use the sample, push the play button to automate the hurricanes on the map. It is also possible to use the forward and rewind buttons to manually cycle through the cumulative hurricanes being displayed.
