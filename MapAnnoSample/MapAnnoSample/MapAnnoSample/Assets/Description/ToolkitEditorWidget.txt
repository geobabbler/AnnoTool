This sample demonstrates being able to add, edit, move, delete, and save features in two FeatureLayers using the ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.Toolkit EditorWidget.

The two editable feature layers represent points of interest and fire evacuation areas.  Use the symbol templates to add new features.  Use the tools to modify or delete existing features. Save your edits when finished to commit any updates to the database.
