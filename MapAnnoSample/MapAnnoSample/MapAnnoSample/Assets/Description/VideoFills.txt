This sample demonstrates the ability to create a SimpleFillSymbol that contains a VideoBrush.  One state, California, is loaded as a FeatureLayer and has its video fill applied in XAML via the FeatureSymbol property.  A GraphicsLayer is initialized in the code-behind with Graphics for a number of other western states.  For these graphics, a MouseEnter handler demonstrates applying a video fill dynamically in code.
