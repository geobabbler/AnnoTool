This sample demonstrates use of the Geoprocessor to call a ViewShed geoprocessing service.  To use the sample, specify a distance and click a point on the map.  Once the viewshed is calculated, it will be shown on the map.

In the code-behind, a Geoprocessor is used to pass the distance and click point to the ViewShed service.  When the results are returned, they are added to a GraphicsLayer and shown in the map.
